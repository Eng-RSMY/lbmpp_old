# Viscosity counteraction model
# This can reduce computation speed on the order of 10%, but ideally would 
#   stabilize runs at lower grid resolutions. 
# 0: no viscosity counteraction.
# 1: steady body force assumption with no spatial term ( inaccurate, explicit ).
# 2: include spatial term ( explicit ).
# 3: include spatial and temporal terms ( not implemented, implicit ).
